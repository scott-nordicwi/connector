# Payload Processing

Data retrieved from a request or event is parsed into a standard model and extractable via a Payload configuration.

 - For example a Date of Birth could be extracted from a FHIR Patient resource and provided back to the Workflow. This Date of Birth field could then be used downstream for another API request or provided back to the business service as part of a custom business object.
