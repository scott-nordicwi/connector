# Connections & Authentication

The Connector is capable of connecting to an EHR instance via a registered application with that EHR. Configurable fields allow you to input the required data from the registered application, such as a client ID, and utilize that for the authentication and API calls.

- The Connector supports any EHR that provides data via web services such as FHIR, custom web services, and MLLP communications such as HL7 v2.
