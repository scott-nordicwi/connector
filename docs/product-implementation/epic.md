# EPIC

Nordic is available to assist with a healthcare system implementation. For Epic healthcare organizations, the software is implemented using a [Home - Epic on FHIR](https://fhir.epic.com/)  or [Home - App Orchard](https://apporchard.epic.com/) application that is registered by the client. Cerner and other EHR vendors follow similar processes.
