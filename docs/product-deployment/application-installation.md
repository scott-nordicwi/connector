# Application Installation

The Healthcare Connector technology can be implemented on AWS and Azure using a deployment template and subsequent configuration for connectivity. The connector is hosted entirely on the cloud and is capable of integrations with our clientâ€™s cloud and on-premise software and databases.

The Nordic team will complete the deployment and initial configuration on your behalf. During this time we will also provide training on how to utilize the software for new configurations and general maintenance. Nordic can also provide complete day-to-day maintenance of the application via a support contract.
