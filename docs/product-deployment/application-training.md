# Application Training

The Healthcare Connector supports interactions with our clients' existing software via SDK, allowing clients to treat the connector as a microservice within their software ecosystem. The SDK communicates the the Healthcare Connector via API calls. SDK libraries are not available in all languages; Nordic can provide an SDK in a given software language upon request.

Because the application is a no-code tool we do not require your software engineering team to be involved in some product configurations. Depending on your integration preferences, product configuration and maintenance can be completed by a Business Analyst or similar role. Integration with the product via SDK or maintenance of the cloud environment may require additional skillsets.
