# Product Overview

## Interoperability

The **Healthcare Connector** is an integration service that enables interoperability across disparate data sources without writing a line of code. A consistent approach to data retrieval, receipt, parsing, and transmission allows our clients to separate integration from business services, to standardize how the services communicate, improve integration monitoring capabilities, and reduce the complexity and cost of data interoperability.

## Healthcare Systems Integration

As a no-code application the Connector enables integration with healthcare systems through standards-based technologies such as FHIR, SMART on FHIR, and HL7 v2 interfaces without any software development. The software is easily deployed onto a cloud platform and configuration is completed using JSON files. Configurations allow our clients to establish connectivity with external and internal systems, create data parsing mechanisms and payloads, and perform other essential functions. This solution is HIPAA compliant to ensure data is safe and secure.
